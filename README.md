An ESP32-based weather report app to help with your prints! 


To get started, upload the microcontroller code from [here](Microcontroller.ino), making sure to change SSID and password. 
This code is for a DHT22 sensor, but can be easily adapted to other sensors. 

Then, download the app from [The Release Page](releases/tag/App). WARNING, this will likely give a "Apple couldn't verify this as safe" warning because I don't have a fancy developer account to notarise it. All you need to do is either right click on the app, and click open, then when the dialog pops up, click "open anyway", or go to settings, privacy and security, scroll to the bottom, and click allow. :)
It's unfortunate, but I don't know if there's a way around it without paying.
