# Clymit


To get started, upload the microcontroller code from [here](Microcontroller.ino), making sure to change SSID and password. 
This code is for a DHT22 sensor, but can be easily adapted to other sensors. 

Then, download the app from [my website](https://appiibara.capydesigns.com). WARNING, this will likely give a "Apple couldn't verify this as safe" warning because I don't have a fancy developer account to notarise it. To open it, double click. It'll give the warning, and two options, one to delete, one to close. Click the close option.
Then, go to settings, privacy and security, scroll to the bottom, and click allow, where it says something like: "FilamentHelper was stopped by this Mac". :)
YOU ONLY HAVE TO DO THIS ONCE! From that point, it runs normally. :D
It's unfortunate, but I don't know if there's a way around it without paying.

Why the file size? I'm using Electron, which is notoriously large for file sizes due to a bundled version of Chromium. The app's updates won't add much storage.
