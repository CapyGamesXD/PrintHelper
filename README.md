# Clymit


To get started, upload the microcontroller code from [here](Microcontroller.ino), making sure to change SSID and password. 
This code is for a DHT22 sensor, but can be easily adapted to other sensors. 


On Chrome, or other Chromium-based browsers, you can go to my website to see the data! 
[Clymit Site](clymit.capydesigns.com)
This feature may be removed in the future, as Chrome may update their cross-origin policies.

Recommended for Mac:

Or, download the app from [my website](https://appiibara.capydesigns.com). 


This will likely give a "Apple couldn't verify this as safe" warning because I don't have a fancy developer account to notarise it. 
If you don't want to bother with this, you can try the website.

There are TWO ways to open it:

1: (The user friendly method) To open it, double click. It'll give the warning, and two options, one to delete, one to close. Click the close option.
Then, go to settings, privacy and security, scroll to the bottom, and click allow, where it says something like: "Clymit was stopped by this Mac". :)
YOU ONLY HAVE TO DO THIS ONCE! From that point, it runs normally. :D
It's unfortunate, but I don't know if there's a way around it without paying.
Maybe in the future I could get an account...

2: (the fancy method) type this command, making sure to edit the path to your .app file: 'xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <PATH>'.
